Dynamic 3D Population Map Using R
This project aims to create an interactive, visually engaging, and informative map that allows users to explore population data in a dynamic way.

Overview
The project visualizes Japan's population density through an interactive 3D map created using R. The map uses color-coded polygons and elevation-based representations to highlight population distribution. Built with the deckgl package, it offers users the ability to interactively explore demographic patterns across different regions of Japan. A custom color palette enhances the visual differentiation of population densities, making it a powerful tool for geographic and demographic analysis.

Prerequisites
To work on this project, familiarity with the following topics is recommended:

Basic Knowledge of R: Understanding the R programming language and its geospatial libraries, such as sf.
GIS Data Handling: Experience in managing geospatial data formats like shapefiles or GeoPackages for visualization.
3D Data Visualization: Basic experience with 3D plotting and creating interactive maps using libraries like deckgl in R.
Libraries and Tools
This project requires the following R libraries:

sf: For reading and handling geospatial data.
R.utils: For decompressing files in .gz format.
scales: For generating custom color scales.
deckgl: For building interactive 3D visualizations.
htmlwidgets: For saving interactive visualizations as HTML files.
RColorBrewer (optional): For additional color palette options.
leaflet: For creating color bins and palette classifications.
Steps
Set Up Required Packages
Ensure that all necessary libraries are installed and loaded. Missing packages are automatically identified and installed.

Download and Extract Population Data
The population data used in this project comes from the Kontur dataset, which provides high-resolution population density data. The data is downloaded in a compressed .gpkg.gz format and extracted using R.utils.

Load and Transform Population Data
Using the sf library, the population data is read and transformed into the WGS84 coordinate reference system (CRS) with EPSG:4326, which is essential for mapping and visualization.

Define a Custom Color Palette
A custom color palette is created to represent population density, with colors ranging from cyan to red. The data is classified into six bins to clearly differentiate between population density levels.

Create an Interactive 3D Map
The deckgl package is used to generate the 3D map. Each polygon is extruded based on its population density, while the color palette visually represents the density levels.

Save the Map as an HTML File
To share the visualization, the interactive map is saved as an HTML file using the htmlwidgets library, enabling easy distribution and access.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to leverage R for creating interactive 3D visualizations of population data. By integrating libraries like deckgl and sf, geospatial data can be transformed into insightful and customizable visualizations. The final map provides a comprehensive and interactive view of Japan's population distribution, offering users a valuable tool for analysis and exploration.
