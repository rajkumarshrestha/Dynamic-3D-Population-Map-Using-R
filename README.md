Dynamic-3D-Population-Map-Using-R

The aim of this project is to provide an interactive, visually appealing, and informative map that helps users explore population data in a dynamic way.

Overview: This project visualizes population density data of Japan in an interactive 3D map using R. The visualization highlights the population distribution using color-coded polygons and elevation-based representation. The map is built with the deckgl package, allowing users to interactively explore population patterns across different regions of Japan. The use of custom color palettes enhances the visual differentiation between population densities, providing a powerful tool for geographic and demographic analysis.

Prerequisites: Basic Knowledge of R: Familiarity with the R programming language and geospatial libraries such as sf is essential. GIS Data Handling: Understanding how to work with geospatial data (like shapefiles or GeoPackages) for map visualization. 3D Data Visualization: Basic experience with 3D plotting and map interactivity using libraries like deckgl in R.

Libraries and Tools: To run this project, the following R libraries are required

sf: For reading and handling geospatial data. R.utils: For unzipping compressed files. scales: For generating color scales. deckgl: For creating interactive 3D visualizations in R. htmlwidgets: For saving the interactive map as an HTML file. RColorBrewer: (Optional) For additional color palette options. leaflet: For handling color binning and palette creation.

Steps:

Set Up the Required Packages To ensure all necessary libraries are installed and loaded, the following code checks for missing packages and installs them if needed.

Download and Extract Population Data We utilize population data from the Kontur dataset, which provides population density at high resolution. The data is compressed in .gpkg.gz format, and we use the R.utils::gunzip() function to extract it.

Load and Transform Population Data Using the sf package, the population data is read and transformed to the WGS84 coordinate reference system (CRS) with EPSG:4326, which is necessary for mapping.

Define a Custom Color Palette We create a custom palette using colors that range from cyan to red to represent population density. The colorBin function is used to classify population data into six bins.

Create an Interactive 3D Map We use the deckgl package to create an interactive 3D map. Each polygon is extruded based on population density, and the color palette reflects the density levels.

Save the Map as an HTML File To share the map, save it as an interactive HTML file using htmlwidgets.

Conclusion: This project demonstrates how to use R to create an interactive 3D map visualizing population data for Japan. With the integration of packages like deckgl and sf, geospatial data can be transformed into insightful visualizations. The final result is a highly customizable, interactive map that provides a comprehensive view of Japan's population distribution.
